## 1. Overview:

Flight delays are a persistent issue in the airline industry, impacting operational efficiency,
finances, and customer satisfaction. Delays, defined as the difference between scheduled and
actual flight times stem from factors such as weather, staffing, maintenance, and congestion.
This project involves building a Decision Support System (DSS) using Tableau to analyse
and visualise flight delay patterns. The goal is to create an interactive, user-friendly platform
that supports data-driven decision-making. Unlike static reports, the DSS features dynamic
dashboards with filters for Delay Type (Arrival/Departure), Airline, Departure/Arrival Airport,
Month of the flight etc. enabling customised exploration.
I used a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising flight schedules,
cancellations, weather data, aircraft details, and airport geolocations. Data preparation and
cleaning are performed using Python addressing issues like duplicates and inconsistencies.
All transformations are documented for transparency.

•	The analysis seeks to answer questions like:
•	What causes delays?
•	How do they vary by location, time, and airline?
•	What is the role of weather and geography?

To support this, I had to apply basic statistical techniques including averages, medians, and further
analysis. The final DSS is published on Tableau Public, allowing users to explore insights interactively
and support better operational and strategic decisions.

3. Public Dataset Inclusion

A consolidated dataset was created by combining publicly available state-wise data on
population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024), median household income (Statista, 2024), and
enplaned passenger counts (Federal Aviation Administration, 2024). This integration helped
in understanding key contextual factors influencing flight cancellations across the U.S.


•	States with larger populations often host busier airports and denser air traffic,
increasing the complexity of flight operations and the likelihood of disruption.
•	Higher median incomes were considered indicative of a greater proportion of
frequent flyers, including business and leisure travellers, potentially influencing both
demand and service expectations.
•	Finally, enplanement volumes served as a proxy for identifying high-traffic airports or
states, which function as critical nodes in the national air travel network and are
therefore more vulnerable to cascading delays and cancellations during operational
stress.


4. Dashboard Overview:

The Flight Delay Insights Dashboard is a comprehensive decision-support tool designed to
analyse and interpret the key drivers of flight delays across the United States in 2023. It brings
together multiple interactive visualizations to provide a holistic view of flight performance,
disruptions, and contributing factors within the U.S. aviation network. The dashboard opens
with a Welcome Page that includes a Glossary of Terms and Navigation Buttons to guide
users through six key views. The glossary defines essential concepts such as delay types,
aircraft age buckets, and disruption categories, ensuring clarity for users of all backgrounds.
Navigation buttons enhance usability by allowing quick access to each section, streamlining
the data exploration experience.
